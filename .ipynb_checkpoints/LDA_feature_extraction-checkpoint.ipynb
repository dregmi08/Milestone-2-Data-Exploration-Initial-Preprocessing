    "# Project Overview\n",
    "## Dataset explanation: Spotify User Review Dataset\n",
    "Our initial dataset, after dropping irrelevant columns, will have 3 columns (before creating our own features). These features are: Review, Total_thumbsup, and Rating. The Review column contains a textual review that a user left, the Total_thumbsup column contains the number of \n",
    "thumbs up a review receives, and the rating contains the corresponding star rating that the user left on the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview/Breakdown\n",
    "Essentially, our project first classifies the reviews in the dataset into three categories: negative, positive, and neutral, and then takes all reviews classified as negative, and ranks the features from most important (the issue that users are complaining the most about) to least\n",
    "important. Our project has two models: one for classifying the sentiment, and one for ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things to note in regards to building our model/testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "The first model is pretty straightforward, we basically classified the reviews based on sentiment into good, positive, and neutral, and we verified our results by checking if a review that was classified as positive had 4-5 stars, checking if a review classified as neutral had 3 stars, and seeing if a review classified as negative had a 1-2 star rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "Our second part (the ranking step) falls more into the category of unsupervised learning. What we decided to do was use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is a technique used for topic modeling to extract different topics amongst the reviews. Each topic has a corresponding sentiment score, and we got the top 10 positive topics (topics with the highest sentiment scores), and top 10 negative topics (topics with the lowest sentiment scores), and assigned descriptive labels to the negative topics (because we are concerned with ranking issues that users complain about). The topic with the lowest sentiment score was assigned the highest ranking, and the topic with the highest sentiment score among all negative topics was assigned the lowest ranking. The tricky part of this milestone was within testing\n",
    "the second part, since we had to go through our reviews and assign the negative reviews with the labels our own labels (we didn't really have a ground truth in the dataset that we could go off of, so we had to create it ourselves), so we used Hugging Face's zero-shot classifier to create a ground truth for us (we passed it the labels for the negative topics) and compared the rankings from this to the rankings our lda model came up with"
